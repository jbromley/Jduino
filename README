Jduino
======

These are the design files (EAGLE 6) for a simple, homebrew Arduino
clone. It uses the Arduino clone from chapter 6 of _Arduino Robotics_
and seeks to make a smaller board that preserves the Arduino
outline. Additionally, I hope to add the following features:

 * power switch,
 * power protection diode,
 * smaller L4931 LDO voltage regulator,
 * right angle FTDI port on edge of board so programming can be done
   with a shield attached.
